# fetch_data.R
# Downloads affordability data from FRED, BLS, Zillow, Census, and (optionally)
# EIA, and writes the static payloads the tracker reads.
#
# Usage:  Rscript fetch_data.R
#
# Outputs:
#   data/app_data.js            — national series (window.AFFORDABILITY_DATA)
#   data/states_index.js        — state/metric catalog (window.AFFORDABILITY_STATES)
#   data/states/{st}.js         — one state, all metrics (window.STATE_DATA[st])
#   data/state_metrics/{id}.js  — one metric, all states (window.STATE_METRIC[id])
#   data/{id}.csv               — per national series (download buttons / inspection)
#   data/state_{id}.csv         — wide date × state CSV per state metric
#   data/manifest.json          — metadata only, no data arrays
#
# Keys (read from .Renviron / environment):
#   BLS_KEY         — required: SA CPI subindexes not on FRED
#   CENSUS_API_KEY  — required: county renter-household weights for state rent
#   EIA_KEY         — optional: state average residential electricity bills;
#                     skipped loudly if absent

# locale, under which non-ASCII characters (en dashes, ÷) get written out as
